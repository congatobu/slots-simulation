# Simulation Code

This repo contains the implementation for simulation purposes of two algorithms for distributed allocation of process slots. These algorithms were adapted to run on top of the [DAJ Toolkit](https://www.risc.jku.at/software/daj/).

Each algorithm is included in its own branch as follows:

* SlotsDonation: branch [SlotsDonation](https://github.com/oajara/slots-simulation/tree/SlotsDonation) 
* Contrast: branch [ContrastSet](https://github.com/oajara/slots-simulation/tree/ContrastSet)
